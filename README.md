## H2O LLM Prototyping Playground

Goal is to create 100% permissive MIT/ApacheV2 LLM model that is useful for ChatGPT usecases.

Training code is based on [Alpaca-LoRA](https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora/), but all models will be fully open source.

No OpenAI-based Alpaca fine-tuning data will be left.
