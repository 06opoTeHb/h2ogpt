### Throttle GPUs in case of reset/reboot

```bash
(alpaca) jon@gpu:/data/jon/alpaca-lora$ sudo nvidia-smi -pl 250
Power limit for GPU 00000000:3B:00.0 was set to 250.00 W from 300.00 W.
Power limit for GPU 00000000:5E:00.0 was set to 250.00 W from 300.00 W.
Power limit for GPU 00000000:86:00.0 was set to 250.00 W from 300.00 W.
Power limit for GPU 00000000:AF:00.0 was set to 250.00 W from 300.00 W.
All done.
```


### Use Wiki Data

```python
>>> from datasets import load_dataset
>>> wk = load_dataset("wikipedia", "20220301.en")
>>> wk
DatasetDict({
    train: Dataset({
        features: ['id', 'url', 'title', 'text'],
        num_rows: 6458670
    })
})
>>> sentences = ".".join(wk['train'][0]['text'].split('.')[0:2])
'Anarchism is a political philosophy and movement that is sceptical of authority and rejects all involuntary, coercive forms of hierarchy. Anarchism calls for the abolition of the state, which it holds to be unnecessary, undesirable, and harmful'
