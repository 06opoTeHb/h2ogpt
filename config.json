Even post pruning, some features have zero importance, because only those genes that have value+variance in        variable importance of value=0.0 get pruned.  GA can have many folds with positive variance        for a gene, and those are not removed in case they are useful features for final model.        If small mojo option is chosen (reduce_mojo_size True), then the variance of feature gain is ignored        for which genes and features are pruned as well as for what appears in the graph.        "

    "output": "orig features fs report refers to Whether to obtain permutation feature importance on original features for reporting in logs and summary zip file(as files with pattern fs_*.json or fs_*.tab.txt).This computes feature importance on a single un-tuned model(typically LightGBM with pre-defined un-tuned hyperparameters)and simple set of features (encoding typically is frequency encoding or target encoding).Features with low importance are automatically dropped if there are many original features,or a model with feature selection by permutation importance is created if interpretability is high enough in order to see if it gives a better score.One can manually drop low importance features, but this can be risky as transformers or hyperparameters might recovertheir usefulness.Permutation importance is obtained by:1) Transforming categoricals to frequency or target encoding features.2) Fitting that model on many folds, different data sizes, and slightly varying hyperparameters.3) Predicting on that model for each feature where each feature has its data shuffled.4) Computing the score on each shuffled prediction.5) Computing the difference between the unshuffled score and the shuffled score to arrive at a delta score6) The delta score becomes the variable importance once normalized by the maximum.   Positive delta scores indicate the feature helped the model score,   while negative delta scores indicate the feature hurt the model score.   The normalized scores are stored in the fs_normalized_* files in the summary zip.   The unnormalized scores (actual delta scores) are stored in the fs_unnormalized_* files in the summary zip.AutoDoc has a similar functionality of providing permutation importance on original features,where that takes the specific final model of an experiment and runs training data set through permutation importance to get original importance,so shuffling of original features is performed and the full pipeline is computed in each shuffled set of original features.

'auto': \"off\"\"        'weight': If duplicates, then convert dropped duplicates into a weight column for training.  Useful when duplicates are added to preserve some distribution of instances expected.  Only allowed if no weight columnn is present, else duplicates are just dropped.        'drop': Drop any duplicates, keeping only first instances.        'off': Do not drop any duplicates.  This may lead to over-estimation of accuracy."
